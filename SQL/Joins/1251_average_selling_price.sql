-- (product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
-- For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

-- Table: UnitsSold

-- | units         | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- This table may contain duplicate rows.
-- Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 

-- Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

-- Let's break this query down step by step, using the Prices and UnitsSold tables you provided, along with an illustration of how the query processes the data.

-- Query Overview
-- sql
-- Copy
-- Edit
-- SELECT 
--     p.product_id, 
--     IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units * price) / SUM(units), 2), 0) AS average_price
-- FROM 
--     Prices p 
-- LEFT JOIN 
--     UnitsSold u
-- ON 
--     p.product_id = u.product_id 
--     AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
-- GROUP BY 
--     product_id;
-- What the query does:

-- Joins the Prices and UnitsSold tables based on product_id and the condition that purchase_date falls within the price period (start_date and end_date).
-- Calculates a weighted average price using SUM(units * price) / SUM(units) for each product_id.
-- Uses IFNULL to handle cases where there are no matches (no sales within the price period), defaulting to 0.
-- Groups the results by product_id to calculate the average price per product.
-- Step-by-Step Execution
-- Step 1: Perform the LEFT JOIN
-- Join Condition:

-- p.product_id = u.product_id
-- u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
-- This matches rows from Prices with rows in UnitsSold where the purchase_date is within the price period.

-- Result of the LEFT JOIN:

-- p.product_id	start_date	end_date	price	u.product_id	purchase_date	units
-- 1	2019-02-17	2019-02-28	5	1	2019-02-25	100
-- 1	2019-03-01	2019-03-22	20	1	2019-03-01	15
-- 2	2019-02-01	2019-02-20	15	2	2019-02-10	200
-- 2	2019-02-21	2019-03-31	30	2	2019-03-22	30
-- Step 2: Calculate Weighted Average for Each Product
-- For each product_id, the weighted average price is calculated as:

-- WeightedÂ AverageÂ Price
-- =
-- SUM(units
-- Ã—
-- price)
-- SUM(units)
-- WeightedÂ AverageÂ Price= 
-- SUM(units)
-- SUM(unitsÃ—price)
-- â€‹
 
-- SUM(units * price):
-- Multiply units by price for each row and sum the results.
-- SUM(units):
-- Sum the units for each product_id.
-- Intermediate Calculations for Each Product:

-- For product_id = 1:

-- SUM(units * price) = (100 * 5) + (15 * 20) = 500 + 300 = 800
-- SUM(units) = 100 + 15 = 115
-- Weighted Average = 800 / 115 = 6.96
-- For product_id = 2:

-- SUM(units * price) = (200 * 15) + (30 * 30) = 3000 + 900 = 3900
-- SUM(units) = 200 + 30 = 230
-- Weighted Average = 3900 / 230 = 16.96
-- Step 3: Handle Nulls with IFNULL
-- If a product has no matching rows (e.g., no sales within the price period), the SUM(units * price) and SUM(units) would be NULL. The IFNULL function replaces this with 0.
-- Step 4: Group by product_id
-- The query groups all calculations by product_id.

-- Final Result:

-- product_id	average_price
-- 1	6.96
-- 2	16.96
-- Step 5: Round to Two Decimal Places
-- The ROUND(..., 2) ensures the result is rounded to two decimal places for presentation.

-- Final Explanation
-- LEFT JOIN ensures all products are included, even if no sales occurred.
-- Weighted average price is calculated for each product based on the number of units sold and their respective prices during the relevant time periods.
-- IFNULL guarantees that products with no sales get an average price of 0.
-- GROUP BY organizes results by product_id.
-- Let me know if anything needs further clarification! ðŸ˜Š







-- You said:
-- so after the joins there are 4 rows total correct?
-- ChatGPT said:
-- ChatGPT
-- Yes, after the LEFT JOIN, there are 4 rows total in the resulting table based on the dataset provided.

-- Hereâ€™s why:

-- The join condition matches rows from Prices and UnitsSold where:

-- p.product_id = u.product_id, and
-- u.purchase_date falls between p.start_date and p.end_date.
-- Each match creates a row in the resulting table. Here's the result after the join:

-- p.product_id	start_date	end_date	price	u.product_id	purchase_date	units
-- 1	2019-02-17	2019-02-28	5	1	2019-02-25	100
-- 1	2019-03-01	2019-03-22	20	1	2019-03-01	15
-- 2	2019-02-01	2019-02-20	15	2	2019-02-10	200
-- 2	2019-02-21	2019-03-31	30	2	2019-03-22	30
-- Key Points:
-- Each row represents a valid match between Prices and UnitsSold based on the product_id and date range.
-- The LEFT JOIN ensures that all rows from Prices are included, even if thereâ€™s no match in UnitsSold. However, in this case, all rows from Prices have a match in UnitsSold.
-- Let me know if you'd like to explore this further! ðŸ˜Š







-- You said:
-- then when we start selecting with the aggregrate function to calculate the average price does it go row by row like

-- 5x 100 / 100
-- 20 x 15 / 15
-- 15 x 200 / 200 and so on?
-- ChatGPT said:
-- ChatGPT
-- Great question! The aggregate functions like SUM() and GROUP BY don't operate row by row. Instead, they group rows by a specified column (in this case, product_id) and perform calculations over all rows in each group simultaneously. Here's how it works:

-- Step-by-Step Breakdown After the JOIN:
-- The intermediate table after the LEFT JOIN looks like this:

-- product_id	start_date	end_date	price	purchase_date	units
-- 1	2019-02-17	2019-02-28	5	2019-02-25	100
-- 1	2019-03-01	2019-03-22	20	2019-03-01	15
-- 2	2019-02-01	2019-02-20	15	2019-02-10	200
-- 2	2019-02-21	2019-03-31	30	2019-03-22	30
-- Now, for each product_id group, the query calculates the weighted average price using the formula:

-- WeightedÂ AverageÂ Price
-- =
-- SUM(units
-- Ã—
-- price)
-- SUM(units)
-- WeightedÂ AverageÂ Price= 
-- SUM(units)
-- SUM(unitsÃ—price)
-- â€‹
 
-- Step 1: Group Rows by product_id
-- The query groups rows by product_id, creating two groups:

-- Group for product_id = 1:
-- product_id	price	units
-- 1	5	100
-- 1	20	15
-- Group for product_id = 2:
-- product_id	price	units
-- 2	15	200
-- 2	30	30
-- Step 2: Perform Calculations Within Each Group
-- Now the aggregate functions (SUM(units * price) and SUM(units)) are applied within each group.

-- For product_id = 1:

-- SUM(units * price) = (100 * 5) + (15 * 20) = 500 + 300 = 800
-- SUM(units) = 100 + 15 = 115
-- Weighted Average Price = 800 / 115 = 6.96
-- For product_id = 2:

-- SUM(units * price) = (200 * 15) + (30 * 30) = 3000 + 900 = 3900
-- SUM(units) = 200 + 30 = 230
-- Weighted Average Price = 3900 / 230 = 16.96
-- Step 3: Generate the Final Output
-- After the calculations, the query produces the final result:

-- product_id	average_price
-- 1	6.96
-- 2	16.96
-- Key Takeaway
-- The query doesn't calculate row by row individually. Instead:

-- Rows are grouped by product_id.
-- Aggregates (SUM(units * price) and SUM(units)) are computed over all rows in each group.
-- The weighted average price is calculated for the entire group.
-- Let me know if you'd like further clarification! ðŸ˜Š







-- You said:
-- so it wont do price of 5 x 100 unnits then divided by 100 like as an enitre row first?
-- ChatGPT said:
-- ChatGPT
-- Correct, the aggregate functions in SQL don't calculate on a row-by-row basis like that. Instead, they compute the aggregate (like SUM or AVG) across all rows within a group created by the GROUP BY clause.

-- Hereâ€™s why:

-- How SQL Aggregate Functions Work:
-- Row Processing:

-- First, the rows from the JOIN are grouped by the column specified in GROUP BY (here, product_id).
-- Within each group, the rows are treated as a collection.
-- Aggregate Calculation:

-- The aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, etc.) operate on all rows within the group to compute a single result for the entire group.
-- What Happens in This Query:
-- For product_id = 1, the grouped rows are:
-- price	units
-- 5	100
-- 20	15
-- SUM(units * price) = (5 * 100) + (20 * 15) = 500 + 300 = 800.
-- SUM(units) = 100 + 15 = 115.
-- Weighted Average = 800 / 115 = 6.96.
-- For product_id = 2, the grouped rows are:
-- price	units
-- 15	200
-- 30	30
-- SUM(units * price) = (15 * 200) + (30 * 30) = 3000 + 900 = 3900.
-- SUM(units) = 200 + 30 = 230.
-- Weighted Average = 3900 / 230 = 16.96.
-- What Does Not Happen:
-- SQL doesn't compute the weighted average price row-by-row (e.g., 5 * 100 / 100, then 20 * 15 / 15). Instead, it considers the entire group as a whole when performing the calculation.

-- This is why aggregate functions like SUM() and AVG() are always applied after grouping.

-- Why This Matters:
-- If SQL calculated the weighted average row by row, it would result in multiple outputs per product (one for each row). However, the GROUP BY ensures that there is one result per group.

-- Let me know if this clarifies things further! ðŸ˜Š







-- You said:
-- SUM(units*price)/SUM(units)

-- so this function on the select will perform the sum(units*price) for every row first added up before dividing by the sum of all units?
-- ChatGPT said:
-- ChatGPT
-- Yes, thatâ€™s exactly how it works! Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

-- 1. Understanding the Formula
-- The formula:

-- SUM(units
-- Ã—
-- price)
-- SUM(units)
-- SUM(units)
-- SUM(unitsÃ—price)
-- â€‹
 
-- is calculating a weighted average:

-- Numerator (SUM(units * price)): Adds up the product of units and price for all rows in the group.
-- Denominator (SUM(units)): Adds up the units for all rows in the group.
-- Finally, the numerator is divided by the denominator once the sums are calculated for the entire group.

-- 2. How It Works on the Rows
-- For product_id = 1, the grouped rows are:

-- price	units
-- 5	100
-- 20	15
-- Step-by-step Calculation:

-- Multiply units * price for each row:

-- Row 1: 
-- 5
-- Ã—
-- 100
-- =
-- 500
-- 5Ã—100=500
-- Row 2: 
-- 20
-- Ã—
-- 15
-- =
-- 300
-- 20Ã—15=300
-- Add up the results (numerator):

-- 500
-- +
-- 300
-- =
-- 800
-- 500+300=800
-- Add up the units (denominator):

-- 100
-- +
-- 15
-- =
-- 115
-- 100+15=115
-- Divide the numerator by the denominator:

-- 800
-- 115
-- =
-- 6.96
-- 115
-- 800
-- â€‹
--  =6.96
-- For product_id = 2, the grouped rows are:

-- price	units
-- 15	200
-- 30	30
-- Step-by-step Calculation:

-- Multiply units * price for each row:

-- Row 1: 
-- 15
-- Ã—
-- 200
-- =
-- 3000
-- 15Ã—200=3000
-- Row 2: 
-- 30
-- Ã—
-- 30
-- =
-- 900
-- 30Ã—30=900
-- Add up the results (numerator):

-- 3000
-- +
-- 900
-- =
-- 3900
-- 3000+900=3900
-- Add up the units (denominator):

-- 200
-- +
-- 30
-- =
-- 230
-- 200+30=230
-- Divide the numerator by the denominator:

-- 3900
-- 230
-- =
-- 16.96
-- 230
-- 3900
-- â€‹
--  =16.96
-- 3. What SQL Does Internally
-- SQL processes this formula as follows:

-- It groups the rows by product_id (defined in GROUP BY).
-- It calculates SUM(units * price) and SUM(units) across all rows in each group.
-- It divides the results of the two aggregate functions for each group to produce the weighted average.
-- Final Output
-- product_id	average_price
-- 1	6.96
-- 2	16.96
-- Key Takeaway:
-- The SUM(units * price) is not calculated row-by-row individually. Instead:

-- All rows in the group contribute to the sum.
-- The division happens after both the numerator and denominator are fully calculated for the group.
-- Let me know if anything is unclear! ðŸ˜Š







-- You said:
-- so this is all because of the group by?
-- ChatGPT said:
-- ChatGPT
-- Yes, exactly! The GROUP BY clause is what causes SQL to treat rows as groups rather than individual rows when calculating aggregates. Let me break this down further to help clarify.

-- How GROUP BY Works with Aggregates:
-- Grouping Rows:

-- The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same value in the specified column(s). In your case, youâ€™re grouping by product_id.
-- So all rows with the same product_id are grouped together, and SQL will calculate the aggregate functions (like SUM and AVG) across all rows within that group.
-- Applying Aggregate Functions:

-- When you use aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), etc., they are applied within each group, not on each row individually.
-- This is why the weighted average calculation works over the entire group of rows for each product_id.
-- In Your Query:
-- sql
-- Copy
-- Edit
-- SELECT p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units*price)/SUM(units),2),0) AS average_price
-- FROM Prices p 
-- LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
-- ON p.product_id = u.product_id AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
-- GROUP BY product_id
-- Hereâ€™s how GROUP BY affects the calculation:

-- Step 1: GROUP BY product_id

-- The GROUP BY product_id statement groups all rows that share the same product_id.
-- For example, all rows where product_id = 1 will be grouped together, and all rows where product_id = 2 will be grouped together.
-- Step 2: Calculate Aggregates

-- SUM(units * price) is calculated for all rows within each product_id group.
-- SUM(units) is also calculated for all rows within each product_id group.
-- Step 3: Calculate Weighted Average

-- The weighted average is calculated as:
-- SUM(units
-- Ã—
-- price)
-- SUM(units)
-- SUM(units)
-- SUM(unitsÃ—price)
-- â€‹
 
-- This happens after the GROUP BY has formed the groups.
-- Without GROUP BY:
-- If you didnâ€™t have the GROUP BY clause, SQL would calculate the aggregates over all rows in the table, and you'd get a single result for the entire table instead of a result for each product. So, using GROUP BY is what allows you to get different results for each product_id.

-- In Summary:
-- The GROUP BY causes SQL to group rows by product_id.
-- The aggregate functions (SUM() in this case) are calculated within each group.
-- The weighted average is then calculated using the summed values within each group.
-- The whole process wouldn't work as expected without the GROUP BY, because you'd be trying to calculate aggregates for all rows rather than grouped by product.

-- Does that clear things up? ðŸ˜Š







-- You said:
-- why do we do the start and end date?
-- ChatGPT said:
-- ChatGPT
-- The start date and end date in your query are used to filter the records from the UnitsSold table based on the purchase date, ensuring that only the units sold within a specific date range are considered in the calculations.

-- Here's why these dates are important:

-- Purpose of the Date Filtering:
-- Contextual Filtering:

-- The Prices table provides price information for a product during specific time periods (from start_date to end_date).
-- The UnitsSold table records the units sold on specific dates.
-- To calculate the average price correctly, we need to ensure that we are only considering the units sold during the time periods when those prices were valid.
-- Prevent Overlapping Prices:

-- Products may have different prices at different times. The start_date and end_date help to match the correct price for a given time period.
-- If a product had a price of 5 from 2019-02-17 to 2019-02-28, and then the price changed to 20 starting 2019-03-01, you wouldnâ€™t want to count units sold in March at the price of 5.
-- Data Relevance:

-- Without date filtering, if a product was sold before the start date or after the end date, you could incorrectly include units sold at prices that weren't valid at the time of purchase.
-- The purchase date in the UnitsSold table must fall between the start_date and end_date in the Prices table to ensure that you only calculate the price for relevant transactions.
-- How It Works in the Query:
-- sql
-- Copy
-- Edit
-- SELECT p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units*price)/SUM(units),2),0) AS average_price
-- FROM Prices p 
-- LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
-- ON p.product_id = u.product_id AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
-- GROUP BY product_id
-- LEFT JOIN:

-- The LEFT JOIN ensures that all prices are included from the Prices table, even if there are no matching records in UnitsSold for that product.
-- ON Clause (Join Condition):

-- p.product_id = u.product_id: This matches the product_id from both tables to ensure the price is linked to the corresponding product.
-- u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date: This condition ensures that we only include units sold between the start_date and end_date for each price period.
-- What Happens:

-- For each product, units sold are filtered by the purchase_date falling within the valid price period (start_date to end_date).
-- For example:
-- If a productâ€™s price is 5 from 2019-02-17 to 2019-02-28, and some units were sold on 2019-02-25, only the price of 5 is applied.
-- If another product's price changed to 20 starting 2019-03-01, the units sold in March will use the price of 20, and units sold in February will use the price of 15 (if the price was 15 during that time).
-- Why We Filter Using Dates:
-- Accuracy: To make sure that the price applied to each sale is accurate and reflects the price valid at the time of the purchase.
-- Correct Calculation: Without date filtering, we risk including sales at outdated prices or missing sales where the price had already changed, which would lead to incorrect calculations of the average price.
-- Example with Date Filtering:
-- Letâ€™s use the data you provided for clarification:

-- Prices Table:
-- product_id	start_date	end_date	price
-- 1	2019-02-17	2019-02-28	5
-- 1	2019-03-01	2019-03-22	20
-- 2	2019-02-01	2019-02-20	15
-- 2	2019-02-21	2019-03-31	30
-- UnitsSold Table:
-- product_id	purchase_date	units
-- 1	2019-02-25	100
-- 1	2019-03-01	15
-- 2	2019-02-10	200
-- 2	2019-03-22	30
-- For product_id = 1:

-- The units sold on 2019-02-25 should be counted at the price of 5 (within the date range 2019-02-17 to 2019-02-28).
-- The units sold on 2019-03-01 should be counted at the price of 20 (within the date range 2019-03-01 to 2019-03-22).
-- If we didnâ€™t use the date filtering (u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date), then we'd wrongly include a sale at a price that wasn't valid for that time period.

-- In Conclusion:
-- Date filtering ensures that only sales within the valid price periods are included in the weighted average calculation.
-- It prevents mixing up prices and ensures that each sale gets counted with the correct price at the time it occurred.
-- Does this explanation make sense? Let me know if you'd like more details! ðŸ˜Š







-- You said:
-- so if the id's match for each table but the date of purchase does not fall inbetween any of the dates then it is omitted?
-- ChatGPT said:
-- ChatGPT
-- Yes, exactly! If the product_id matches between the two tables, but the purchase_date does not fall within the start_date and end_date range for that specific price in the Prices table, then the corresponding row from the UnitsSold table is omitted from the calculation in the result.

-- Let me explain how this works with an example:

-- Example:
-- Prices Table:
-- product_id	start_date	end_date	price
-- 1	2019-02-17	2019-02-28	5
-- 1	2019-03-01	2019-03-22	20
-- 2	2019-02-01	2019-02-20	15
-- 2	2019-02-21	2019-03-31	30
-- UnitsSold Table:
-- product_id	purchase_date	units
-- 1	2019-02-25	100
-- 1	2019-03-01	15
-- 2	2019-02-10	200
-- 2	2019-03-22	30
-- What Happens During the Join:
-- For product_id = 1:
-- The row with purchase_date = 2019-02-25 will be included because the purchase_date is within the date range 2019-02-17 to 2019-02-28.
-- The row with purchase_date = 2019-03-01 will be included because the purchase_date is within the date range 2019-03-01 to 2019-03-22.
-- For product_id = 2:
-- The row with purchase_date = 2019-02-10 will be included because the purchase_date is within the date range 2019-02-01 to 2019-02-20.
-- The row with purchase_date = 2019-03-22 will not be included because the purchase_date does not fall between the valid date range 2019-02-21 to 2019-03-31 for the second price entry. So, this row will be omitted.
-- Key Points:
-- Omission due to date mismatch: If thereâ€™s a product_id match but the purchase_date doesnâ€™t fit the range of the price period, the UnitsSold row will be excluded from the calculation.

-- Resulting Calculation: The SUM(units*price) and SUM(units) will only include the units that were sold within the valid date ranges, ensuring that the price applied to those units is accurate.

-- In the Query:
-- sql
-- Copy
-- Edit
-- SELECT p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units*price)/SUM(units),2),0) AS average_price
-- FROM Prices p 
-- LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
-- ON p.product_id = u.product_id AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
-- GROUP BY product_id
-- LEFT JOIN: All rows from the Prices table are included, even if there are no matching rows in the UnitsSold table.
-- ON Clause: The rows in the UnitsSold table will only match if the purchase_date falls between the start_date and end_date for the respective product's price.
-- So, to answer your question: Yes, if the purchase date doesn't fall within the valid price period, that row is omitted from the final result, and it won't affect the aggregation (sum, average, etc.).
