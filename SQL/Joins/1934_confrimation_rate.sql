-- (user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
-- user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
-- action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
-- Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
 

-- The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

-- Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

-- Explanation: 
-- User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
-- User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
-- User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
-- User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.

Query Explanation:
Select user_id from the Signups table:

We want to get the user_id from the Signups table for every user who signed up.
LEFT JOIN with the Confirmations table:

We're doing a LEFT JOIN between the Signups table (s) and the Confirmations table (c) on user_id.
This means we will retrieve all the rows from the Signups table, even if there is no corresponding record in the Confirmations table (i.e., users who did not confirm their signup).
USING (user_id) makes the user_id the joining condition between the two tables.
AVG(IF(c.action='confirmed',1,0)):

We're calculating the average of a conditional expression:
If the action in the Confirmations table is 'confirmed', it returns 1.
If the action is not 'confirmed' (e.g., it's 'timeout'), it returns 0.
The AVG function computes the average of these 1s and 0s, effectively giving the confirmation rate for each user.
ROUND(..., 2) rounds the average confirmation rate to two decimal places.
GROUP BY s.user_id:

Finally, we group the results by user_id from the Signups table. This ensures that the query calculates the confirmation rate for each user.
Step-by-Step Walkthrough with Visuals:
Letâ€™s walk through how this query works step-by-step.

Step 1: LEFT JOIN the Two Tables
We start by performing a LEFT JOIN between the Signups table and the Confirmations table on user_id.

Result of LEFT JOIN:
s.user_id	s.time_stamp	c.user_id	c.time_stamp	c.action
3	2020-03-21 10:16:13	3	2021-01-06 03:30:46	timeout
3	2020-03-21 10:16:13	3	2021-07-14 14:00:00	timeout
7	2020-01-04 13:57:59	7	2021-06-12 11:57:29	confirmed
7	2020-01-04 13:57:59	7	2021-06-13 12:58:28	confirmed
7	2020-01-04 13:57:59	7	2021-06-14 13:59:27	confirmed
2	2020-07-29 23:09:44	2	2021-01-22 00:00:00	confirmed
2	2020-07-29 23:09:44	2	2021-02-28 23:59:59	timeout
6	2020-12-09 10:39:37	NULL	NULL	NULL
Explanation:
For user_id = 3, there are two rows in the Confirmations table with action = 'timeout', so both rows are returned.
For user_id = 7, there are three rows with action = 'confirmed', so all three are returned.
For user_id = 2, there are two rows: one with action = 'confirmed' and the other with action = 'timeout', so both rows are returned.
For user_id = 6, there are no matching records in the Confirmations table (NULL values), meaning no confirmations are present for this user.
Step 2: Calculate the Confirmation Rate
Now we calculate the confirmation rate for each user. We use the AVG(IF(c.action='confirmed',1,0)) to count how many confirmations there are.

For each user, we evaluate the action:
s.user_id	action	value (1 if confirmed, 0 if not)
3	timeout	0
3	timeout	0
7	confirmed	1
7	confirmed	1
7	confirmed	1
2	confirmed	1
2	timeout	0
6	NULL	NULL
Now we calculate the average confirmation rate for each user:
For user_id = 3:
Confirmation values: [0, 0]
Average: (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.00
For user_id = 7:
Confirmation values: [1, 1, 1]
Average: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.00
For user_id = 2:
Confirmation values: [1, 0]
Average: (1 + 0) / 2 = 0.50
For user_id = 6:
No confirmation actions, so the confirmation rate is NULL (no data).
Step 3: Final Grouping and Rounding
The query groups the results by user_id and rounds the average confirmation rate to two decimal places. The final result looks like this:

s.user_id	confirmation_rate
3	0.00
7	1.00
2	0.50
6	NULL
Final Explanation:
user_id 3 has a confirmation rate of 0.00 (since none of their actions were 'confirmed').
user_id 7 has a confirmation rate of 1.00 (all actions were 'confirmed').
user_id 2 has a confirmation rate of 0.50 (one confirmation and one timeout).
user_id 6 has NULL because there are no matching confirmation actions in the Confirmations table.
Final Output:
The result of the query will be:

user_id	confirmation_rate
3	0.00
7	1.00
2	0.50
6	NULL
Conclusion:
This query calculates the confirmation rate for each user by looking at how many of their actions were 'confirmed', compared to all actions (including 'timeout'). The LEFT JOIN ensures all users are included, even if they don't have any corresponding records in the Confirmations table.
